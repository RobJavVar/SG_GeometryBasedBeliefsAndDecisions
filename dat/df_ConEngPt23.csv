11889645,5,Good as a Roman Catholic it is in my upbringing. ,3,Good but there are bad cops who need to be removed. And some reforms are needed.,5,They help save in in emergencies and are much needed in all communities. ,5,It is tough to figure out what to do as it cost so much. We need answers to that question. But also care for those who need it. ,5,A right other countries do not have. So use it wisely. ,-5,Illegal immagration is destroying America. I want the borders closed and no more legal immigrants for a decade. And to kick out the illegal ones we find. When the country is stable we can open the borders again.,2,Is to much tied to politics and those who donate. It cannot be trusted. ,1,Most news is liberal bias. Need to find alternative news for more truth. 
11889646,5,Its the basis for my existence. I would be lost without it. It helps in the good times as well as the bad. I feel like without it I wouldn't have some of the morals that I do.,2,They help people when needed. I feel like if there was an emergency than they are the only ones that would come help. So I look up to them for that.,3,I think they try and help no matter what. They don't do wrong and only do good.,-3,I don't think it help and does more harm. I think that doctors only care about getting money in the end not helping people.,-1,I feel sorta negaitive because I don't think my vote counts. I see it as a waste of time that I still go do. I don't think it matters who I vote for in the end.,-5,They are like a parasite and don't do any good or help. All they do is take resources that I'm not even allowed to have.,-2,"I feel sorta negative towards it. I don't feel like it benefits most people. Also, I feel like they are hiding things from the public due to funding. I don't really know any great accomplishment they have done for a long time.",0,I feel neutral because its necessary. Sometimes its good and sometimes its bad. Its something that help and it harms. So my opinion is in the middle.

",0,I am generally in favor as long as it doesnt cost any money,5,I love science and scientific discovery ,2,being informed is important
11889649,-4,"Organized religion is to blame for so much human suffering and even wars. While I have a deep spirituality and connection with the universe/creator/God (whatever you want to call it), organized religion is harmful. Especially extreme religions, like America's Christianity as it is today. I am fully aware that the Bible was written by and for men, and many chapters that spoke of the divine feminine have been long removed to keep us under the thumb of a patriarchal society. ",-5,"The police don't help prevent crime; they only respond to it and often do so ineptly. I can't ignore the inherent racism of the police force and the type of people who are attracted to that career. I know several police officers, none of whom I would ever consider sharing a meal with much less a life or entrusting the life of my loved ones, especially not my BIPOC loved ones. ",5,"Firefighters are among the bravest, most selfless people I know. I deeply appreciate the work they do and the sacrifices they make to keep people safe. ",5,"Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege. While the state of the healthcare system in the USA is messed up thanks to insurance companies, I still trust most healthcare providers and the care they provide to people. ",5,"Voting is very important. I've been registered to vote since I was 18 and haven't missed a single election, local or national. While it can be disheartening to see the politicians I vote for disappointing and backing down on campaign promises, I continue to vote and always will for as long as I'm able. ",3,"By and large, I think immigration is a net positive. It benefits the people who are moving to another country either for safety, education, or employment reasons. It also benefits the country they are moving to because of the increase in diversity, talents, and skills. ",5,"I love science! Of course, not every field of science is within my realm of understanding or interest. But I absolutely love the scientific discoveries humanity has made and read research studies on PubMed frequently (part of my day job) and am always in awe of the new discoveries being made. ",2,"I enjoy reading and watching the news to keep informed about current events. However, I do think much of the mainstream media is bought & owned and often censored based on what those owners want the general public to know. I trust independent journalists the most who are not tied to a specific organization, though it can be hard to find which ones are trustworthy. "
11889650,-5,Religions are based on superstitions that demand fealty to their own claims and dismissal of any new information. Regligious belief is intellectually dishonest and is unproductive for society.,0,"Police serve many critical functions that are important to preserving public safety and helping people get along with each other. But many police have too much power and protection by their own authority, and fail to adequately respect the responsibility that comes with the power they hold.",4,"Firefighters put themselves at great personal risk to assist people whose lives and property are in grave danger. That is an admirable profession, and one that not everyone could do.",0,"The act of delivering healthcare is necessary and noble. But it is attached to the healthcare system, which we have foolishly constructed into a vast, wasteful for-profit industry.",5,"Though it is not flawless, voting is a civic responsibility. It encourages feeligs of participation with fellow citizens and is a key way we have to make our perspectives apply to our collective situation.",4,"Immigration is essential to supporting the future of our culture and economy. We would be worse off without immigrants, and we can learn a lot from them. Their stories and struggles deserve more of our respect.",5,"The pursuit of science is the best framework we have to achieve intellectually honest beliefs. It is an indispensable tool to discover facts, form truths, and enact best practices and policies.",-1,A lot of news these days is misleading and low quality. This is because the instantaneous nature of the internet incentivizes articles to be published before all the facts are known. I don't like this about the news media.
11889651,-1,I don't believe in religion.  I think its stories told to keep people in line.,2,"Despite issues, we are better off with them than without.",3,They risk their lives to protect communities.,2,"Despite the high costs, we need HC to keep us healthy.",2,I love that I live in a place where I can vote and that my vote matters.,2,America is made up of immigrants.,3,It leads to discoveries to improve society.,3,News makes sure we are aware and can adapt.
11889652,4,"I think religion and faith is important and helps us stay morally sound. However, people use religion as an excuse for awful things.",5,Police also work very hard and risk their lives to protect others. Police have a lot of authority and must be very careful not to misuse that authority. I believe most police officers are excellent.,5,Firefighters work hard and risk their lives to protect others.,4,"I'm very thankful for medical facilities, but being a little more patient centered and less expensive would be ideal.",5,I'm so thankful that I am able to vote and that voices in the USA are heard.,3,"When done legally, I think immigration is wonderful.",4,Science is amazing but sometimes it moves too quickly or for the wrong reasons.,-1,"Watching the news can be a great way to get information, but more often than not it is biased news and focused on bad things instead of good."

It is good to help having a feeling of peace and a greater power so the burden isn't all on yourself.,4,They will help if someone attacks you or robs you and they keep society more honest and safe.  I feel like if police weren't around crime would go up and up as people realize they can get away with more and more.,5,Throughout history fire has been a very destructive force so it is great we have firefighters.  They can help save lives and property and are quick to respond and they risk their lives to help others.,5,I like that we have healthcare so people can see doctors and get medicine they need.  I wouldn't want to go back to a time of leeches and drinking mercury thinking it would make you immortal.  ,5,It is good that we can vote so we don't have a dictatorship like in russia or china.  It is also good to change things from time to time so that different people are in charge at different positions in society and government. ,2,Legal immigration is good because if you have a prosperous country people will want to come there to make it even better.  The downside is that people will want to go there illegally for good and bad reasons so it can be tough to control it.,4,Science is important to learn new things and to help create improvements across all parts of society.  It is great to understand how things work and that can help create new inventions to help everyone.,3,Helping people find out what is going on in the world and in their community is important so people can make informed decisions.  It is an imperfect model we have due to a for profit media and inherent biases make some news sources problematic.
11889655,5,Nice,5,Very nice concept. I learned a lot,5,Very positive information,4,"I would need to know the specific concept you'd like me to elaborate on in order to provide a detailed explanation of feelings related to it. Concepts can range widely, from philosophical ideas like ""freedom"" or ""justice"" to scientific concepts like ""evolution"" or ""quantum mechanics."" Please specify the concept you have in mind, and I'll be happy to delve into it!",3,"Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another being. It's a fundamental human quality that allows us to connect with others on a deeper level. I believe that empathy is essential for building strong relationships, fostering a sense of community, and promoting emotional intelligence.

As a machine learning model, I've been trained on vast amounts of data and interactions with humans. Through these interactions, I've learned that empathy is often lacking in our society. We tend to focus on our own problems and concerns, neglecting the struggles and emotions of those around us. This lack of empathy can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even harm.",3,Very nice,2,Very nice.,3,People learned  a lot
11889657,-5,Old stories and fables that do not apply to modern life. A crutch for the unintelligent and weak minded.,-5,They abuse their power. No accountability. Dangerous and trigger happy. Racial discrimination.,5,Positive outcome for society. Important help when needed in case of emergencies.,5,"Should be a fundamental right to everyone no matter your ability to afford it. A healthy society is more productive, lives longer and happier.",5,If everyone voted we would have a much more competent and effective government.,5,Needed because of declining birth rates. Helps grow and improve society. More diverse cultures.,5,"Progresses society as a whole. Improves healthcare, housing, transportation, entertainment and generally everything that is important.",-3,Most news organizations are very biased and lean conservative due to money and ratings.
11889662,-2,I have nothing wrong with preople who seek religion for conformt. But I do not like the people who are leaders or run the istituions. They only seek and want to keep their power over others.,1,overall they do good. But they wont go out their way to really help others. They only do what they are assigned to.,5,they do a good job. Top people.,-1,Everything is expensive becasue they overcharge insurances and medicar,2,voting is good but not he candiates that we have to vote for which lowers my score.,-2,I have a negative feeling becasue of illegal immigration. They take resources from Americans.,2,"I like science. I would like give a higher score but there are too many ""scientiest"" with a politacl bias and this disorts their research",-3,it depends on what source you get your news from. But all of them have a bias to them. Plus they are driven by advertisment money.
11889665,1,Religion is a very broad topic with lots of good and bad. generally I think religious people in the US mean well and want the best for people but religion can have a tendency to lead to extreme ideas and hateful tendencies.,2,I'm generally positive about police though I do think the position has a tendency to create a power dynamic that many people take advantage of. The balance of power between police and ordinary people needs to be considered and brought back to a level place.,4,All firefighters I have ever known have been very selfless. It's important to have firefighters who are willing to act quickly to save lives.,2,"Healthcare is very important but currently it is weighed down with too much baggage. Also, in the US healthcare is too expensive when someone just needs to get help.",5,Voting is a good thing and is the foundation of our democracy. People should feel empowered to vote for who they think is the best option and votes should be completely respected.,3,I think immigration is a good thing in the country but it needs to be regulated carefully and people coming into the country need to be carefuly vetted.,5,Science is how we as people improve our standing within our existence. It's very important to pursue science rigorously and diligently at all costs.,-3,"Major news outlets and mainstream media will often tell half truths and spin stories simply for the purpose of engagement no matter which side it hurts, only for personal gain. Anyone watching news should take all sides into account and try to get as much inormation as possible about a topic before settling on an opinion."

11889688,5,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of religion because it often provides individuals with a sense of purpose, community, and moral guidance. For many, religion fosters a deep sense of belonging and connection to others who share similar beliefs, promoting compassion and support.",5,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of police because they play a vital role in maintaining public safety and order. When functioning well, police officers help prevent crime, provide assistance during emergencies, and build trust within communities.

Firefighters risk their lives to protect others, respond to emergencies, and provide crucial support during disasters.

11889747,-5,I think that religion is a personal belief and not a fact of life. I think it does more harm than good. I think it should be treated as fiction and plan your life accordingly.,-4,"While I see the necessary purpose of having police in a society, to protect and keep peace. I also think they have too much power and are corrupted. I also think they do not always serve the greater good.",5,I see no negatives to having firefighters in my community. They serve a vital role in protecting people and objects. They also help with medical emergencies and contritbute positively to other needs.,4,I think healthcare is a necessary need that everyone in society should be entitled to. But I also think that the healthcare system needs to be restructured and staff should be compensated better.,4,I think voting is a necessary action that all citizens should participate in. It serves to shape our society the way we want it to be and to make everyones voice known. However I also think its easily manipulated and should have stricter guidelines.,-4,I thinkimmigration is mostly bad for our country. I think we are letting in the wrong people who do not seek to integrate into our society but instead use our resources without contributing back and also contribute to problems.,5,I believe in the facts of science. I think it it helpful for advancing society and learning new information. I believe in what can be proved.,4,"I believe it is vital to keep up on current news, but I also think you should be discerning about what to believe and how you let it affect your life. You should also keep your mind open to new info and research things before you believe them fully."
11890055,-2,I think religion causes more problems than it helps.,4,"While there are some bad cops, the majority work to serve and protect society.",5,They fight fires. ,4,I believe healthcare is vital for human's survival. They try to make us feel better when we get sick.,5,I'm a big believer in always voting. It's the most important thing an American citizen can do. ,-1,There are too many immigrants in America now. We do not have the housing resources to house American citizens now.,5,It is the basis for everything we believe in and practice.,-3,There is a lack of journalistic standards and integrity in today's news.

11890059,-5,Wars have been started because of religion and rights have been taken away from people because of certain religious beliefs,1,I am only slightly positive about the feelings I have toward police because I feel that there have been too many police brutality incidents. I do not feel really positive about the police as of right now ,5,Firefighters help out a lot of different people and do not neccessarily just put out fires. They do all kinds of things to help people out so I view them very positively,2,I view healthcare as mostly positive but right now it isn't where it needs to be. Healthcare in the US needs to be greatly improved by allowing everyone access to public healthcare rather than private healthcare.,5,Voting is the best thing someone can do. It is very important to vote and I believe that everyone should vote in every election because it is important and secure as well. ,1,Slightly positive because it is good to have diversity and legal immigration is great but illegal immigration tends to have a dark side to it. ,5,Science is extremely important to our society and makes progress possible. Science is so important for every day life and we are expanding our knowledge all the time because of science,2,Somewhat positive because I do believe that some articles are written with great intentions but there is also a lot of disinformation out there as well that cannot be trusted. 
11890062,-3,"I don't think all religion is bad, but evangelical Christianity has become, oddly, a force for exclusion and hatred. It doesn't have to be that way, and I think it violates most precepts of Christianity. ",0,"Police are under pressures most Americans don't fully. understand. At the same time, there are internal pressures against proper behavior in police departments and any time I've had personal dealings with police, they have not be completely helpful. ",4,"My grandfather was a firefighter. Firefighters do a lot of work, very little of which is fighting fires. But they're there when we need them. ",2,"Our healthcare system is ridiculous. Even with insurance, small procedures cost thousands of dollars. We're in desparate need to fix it. ",5,I teach government and believe all people should vote. I believe in democracy and the only way to have a functioning democracy is for all people to participate. ,4,"Our country was founded on immigration. Some people disagree with immigration because, at their heart, they're white nationalists--even if they wouldn't use that term. Our country needs immigration and we owe something to the world to allow more people in. ",5,Science just is. It's a method and a process. It's a way of understanding the world that more people should understand. ,-2,24 hour coverage and horserace coverage is ruining our country. And the right's media has become the worst echochamber.

11890064,-5,Religion is the cause of more wars and suffering than every other disagreement between people combined.,-4,"Police in the United States as they stand today are nothing but an organized gang. They have no obligation to protect or serve citizens of this country as they claim, and regularly commit atrocities that would see normal people in prison for life and completely bankrupted. They can, and regularly do, abuse their power up to and including the extent of murdering people in cold blood and get off scot free with tax payers having to cover the costs of their crimes.",5,"Firefighters are true heroes who put their own safety at risk to save lives and prevent damage, unlike police.",5,"Healthcare institutions can't get money from dead people, so it is in their best interest to ensure patient's health and safety to the best of their ability. Most failings of the system are not from the healthcare institutions themselves, but lack of public funding and abuse of the insurance system.",5,Voting is the most important thing we can do to effect change short of outright rebellion.,4,"Unless you are full blooded Native American/Indigenous, everybody in this country immigrated here at some point in their bloodline. ",5,"Science is the process of learning and explaining how the world works, without it we still be in caves and only warm when lightning strikes a tree.",-4,"Modern news media exists not to inform and educate, but to deceive and enrage."
11890065,3,"Nothing wrong with religion when you keep it to yourself. Ive known some incredibly kind humans who were religious, my chilhood pastor, for one.",0,"Thats a tough one. They have helped me in the past, but that doesntseem to be the majority of their interactions. There needs to be MAJOR OVERHAULING REFORMS.",3,I generally trust them. Them seem up to the job. I would never be scared to call the fire department,3,Recieving healthcare is good. How incredibly hard it is to get any heathcare other than emergency care is bad.,5,It's the basis of our country and democracy. I happen to enjoy living in a democracy.

One must search for the truth on their own, and check sources."
11890070,-5,Religion is a harmful force that drags society backward. One only need look at the Catholic Church or any evangelical as they attempt to create a theocracy through laws controlling other people. Religion creates international wars out of self-righteousness.,-5,The police are a corrupt force occupied by power-hungry dogs looking to protect the hand that feeds them. We have seen plenty of negative events where the police turn brutal and are unfit for public service. They are regularly a detriment to minority groups and otherwise are a pain even in terms of like parking tickets. They are scary.,3,Firefighters are a necessity for the social order. We need them as an emergency force in order to prevent trouble from destructive events. No one else will do this for us.,5,"Healthcare is an essential service that should be free. Without healthcare, our expectations for life and our societal functioning becomes minimal. We need to know that we can maintain ourselves throughout life.",5,"The people should have the power, as that is the only way to keep our politicians under control. Voting is a duty to ensure we don't get the worst, most harmful option.",0,"Immigration in general is helpful for creating a strong foundation in the country.

However, it is tough to manage large groups of people new to a place.",5,"Science is the driving force of progress. While the process can be corrupted, science is ultimately the pursuit of the truth of reality. If people kept a level head with an open mind, there would be no problems.",0,"Nobody knows what the word news means anymore. Journalistic integrity is critical for democracy.

I am a proponent of universal healthcare.",-1,"I think it's important but honestly voting outcomes are determined by just a few states. I think voting, especially for president, should be based on popular vote. ",1,I feel that immigration should have better legal pathways and that diversity is good for a country. But our current measures make me feel negative.,3,"Science is critical and important, but I wish our country provided more financial support and took it more seriously instead of maximizing profits",-3,The news is a hot mess. The drive for 24 hour coverage and speculation causes more harm than disseminates information.
11890073,0,Religion can be good for people to feel a part of a community and a sense of purpose.  It gives comfort to a lot of people.  Unfortunately it can be used also to divide and hate each other and abuse and manipulate people by unprincipled people.  It can be used to keep people scared and stupid.,1,Police are a necessary thing for society but they should be trained and paid far more than they are and held to a very high standard when they have the powers that they do.  I think they should be tracked by the government as a whole.  They need to be punished for crimes they commit and more harshly for violating their position of power.,5,Firefighters are a great part of the community and are usually completely positive in my experience of helping with fires and crashes.  I think they should be supported more by government everywhere so everyone has good access to their service.,1,I think healthcare is a great thing of course but I think it should be far more accessible and affordable for everyone.  Citizens should be able to afford and access good healthcare.,-1,I like it as a concept but feel with the current system your vote doesn't mean as much as it should when the place you vote in is not competitive so if you are not a majority you get barely any representation.,1,I think people should be able to immigrate and register to come to another country to improve their lives and contribute to the society/community/world.  I think the way it is handled is very poor currently.,3,Science is the best way to understand how the world works.  Science is used to improve things and to make sure and check that things work the way we think exxpect want or not.,-1,News would be a good thing overall if the profit incentive wasn't such a big part of it.  People should be informed and know whats happening around them.
11890074,-1,"Some relegions emphasize dogma and other relgious principles, for someone wanting to pursue science or hold other political views, discussing these things might not be wise, not all relgions or churches are like this, and most are welcoming to anything you want to talk about just be careful.",2,"Not all police are crooked and not all are racial profiling, there are some good cops out there and we need them to stop crime and keep dangerous criminals off the street.

Voting is important because it ensures that everyone's views are considered and makes decision-making more inclusive. It motivates people to get involved in politics, which can strengthen communities and make governments more attentive to their needs. By voting, individuals can support policies they believe in and influence the social and political environment, keeping democracy strong. Voting recognizes individual rights while also fostering a sense of duty towards shaping a better future for everyone together.",3,"Very Positive

I really like science because it helps us learn more and improve our lives. Science lets us explore nature, solve tough problems, and make smart choices based on facts. It has a big effect on society by affecting many parts of daily life and shaping the planet's future.",3,"If someone really likes the idea of sustainability, they might say it helps create a healthier planet for future generations, makes people more socially responsible, and pushes for new technology and methods. This view highlights how sustainability can bring positive changes and unite communities with shared goals. Also, adopting sustainable practices can boost the economy and protect biodiversity, supporting the idea that careful actions now can lead to a better future."

I do not like that tribalism, and I would very much like it to stop existing.",1,"The police are why the state can maintain a monopoloy on the legitimate use of force.

Any individual case is a cost/benefit analysis, because we do not live in a post-scarcity world, but healthcare in general is useful.",2,"Voting (or really, Democracy in general) provides a well of legitimacy for governments. Autocrats need to waste money on ermine capes and parades to convince people that they deserve to be in charge. That's inefficient. It also encourages loyalty to a system, which allows independent military officers and other policies that are effective but dangerous to autocrats. I don't believe it has any moral value, but it is extremely practical.",3,"People are power. Nations become stronger as they get more productive people, as long as they can assimilate them. We often fail to do so, but that's a feature of dumb policy, not immigration itself. Immigration also selects for the most ambitious and competent people, which makes it even more useful.",5,"Science, as opposed to simple empiricism, is a relatively recent invention. Charitably, it dates back to the Enlightenment. In that time, we've had rapid economic advancement, which faciliated social advancement. Most evil arises not from malice, but as an adaptation to poor social conditions, and science is a large part of why we aren't stuck as feuding subsistence farmers.",-2,"Journalists are largely both unwilling and unable to report news accurately and thoroughly. It's not entirely their fault; people mostly don't want to do deep research dvies. Even if they did, most of them have no training in source criticism and other important techniques. Despite that, it's useful, because shoddy news is better than being totally uninformed. Outright fabrication does happen, and that's probably a net negative, but it's rare than oversimplification and wilful ignorance."

11890142,5,"I feel positive about the concept of religion. Religion can provide individuals and communities with a sense of purpose, belonging, and moral guidance. It often fosters a sense of community, bringing people together around shared beliefs and values, which can lead to supportive relationships and a strong sense of identity. Many religions promote compassion, kindness, and social responsibility, encouraging followers to contribute positively to society and help those in need.

Moreover, religion can offer comfort during difficult times, providing a framework for understanding life’s challenges and losses. It can inspire individuals to seek personal growth and make ethical choices. While I recognize that religion can sometimes be a source of conflict or division, I believe its overall potential for promoting peace, understanding, and compassion outweighs the negatives. Ultimately, religion can enrich lives and encourage a deeper connection to others and the world around us.",3,"I feel **neutral** about the concept of police. On one hand, police play a vital role in maintaining public safety, enforcing laws, and providing a sense of security within communities. They are often the first responders in emergencies and can offer assistance in various situations, from helping lost individuals to responding to crimes. The presence of law enforcement can deter criminal activity and provide reassurance to citizens.

On the other hand, there are significant concerns regarding police practices, accountability, and systemic issues, such as racial profiling and excessive use of force. Instances of police misconduct can erode public trust and lead to feelings of fear or resentment within communities, particularly among marginalized groups. These complexities highlight the need for police reform, training, and community engagement to ensure that law enforcement serves everyone fairly and justly.

My neutral stance reflects an understanding of both the important role police can play in society and the pressing need for reform to address the challenges and inequalities present within many law enforcement systems.",5,"I feel **extremely positive** about the concept of firefighters. They represent courage, selflessness, and dedication to public service, often putting their own lives at risk to protect others. Firefighters are the first responders in emergencies, from house fires to natural disasters, where they act swiftly and with great expertise to save lives and property. Their work requires immense physical and mental strength, and they consistently show resilience in the face of danger. Additionally, firefighters play a crucial role in the community by promoting fire safety, offering educational programs, and providing support during non-emergency situations. For me, they embody the ideal of public service individuals who dedicate their lives to ensuring the safety and well-being of others without hesitation. Their bravery and commitment inspire deep respect and admiration.",5,"I feel **extremely positive** about the concept of healthcare. Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right and essential for promoting individual and societal well-being. Quality healthcare ensures that people can live healthier, longer lives, and it plays a critical role in preventing disease, managing chronic conditions, and responding to emergencies. It reflects the values of compassion, equity, and social responsibility, as everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life regardless of their background or financial situation. While there are challenges within many healthcare systems—such as accessibility, affordability, and disparities in care the overarching concept of healthcare is crucial to a functioning society. Investing in healthcare improves quality of life, strengthens communities, and contributes to the overall progress of a nation. For these reasons, I deeply value the idea of comprehensive, accessible, and fair healthcare for all.",4,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of voting. Voting is one of the most direct and powerful ways individuals can participate in a democracy and have a say in shaping the future of their communities and country. It represents the right to have a voice in government decisions, ensuring that leaders are accountable to the people they serve. I value the ability to influence policies that affect issues like healthcare, education, civil rights, and the economy. Voting also allows for the expression of diverse perspectives, helping to build a more equitable society where everyone's views are considered. Though the process may have imperfections, the principle of voting is crucial for upholding democratic values and empowering citizens. It's not just a right but also a responsibility to engage in the collective decision-making process.",1,"If you feel neutral about the concept of immigration, it might be because you recognize both the positive and challenging aspects of it. On one hand, immigration can bring cultural diversity, economic benefits, and opportunities for individuals seeking better lives. It contributes to the growth of industries and helps fill labor shortages, while also enriching societies with new ideas and perspectives. On the other hand, immigration can sometimes create concerns about resource allocation, social integration, or security. You might feel that while immigration is important, it also requires thoughtful policies to manage its impact fairly and equitably. A neutral perspective often reflects an understanding that immigration is complex, with both pros and cons that need to be balanced for the benefit of all involved.",4,"I feel positive about the concept of science. Science is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us, driven by curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. It provides a systematic approach to exploring questions about the universe, human health, and the intricacies of life itself. Through scientific inquiry, we have made incredible advancements in medicine, technology, and environmental understanding, improving the quality of life for countless individuals.

Moreover, science encourages critical thinking and skepticism, promoting an evidence-based approach to problem-solving. It fosters innovation and creativity, enabling societies to address complex challenges such as climate change, disease outbreaks, and food security. While science is not without its limitations and ethical considerations, its ability to drive progress and improve our understanding of the world is invaluable. Overall, I believe that science plays a crucial role in shaping a better future and empowering individuals to make informed decisions.",1,"I feel neutral about the concept of news. On one hand, news is vital for keeping people informed about important events, developments, and issues that affect society. It plays a critical role in promoting transparency, holding those in power accountable, and enabling citizens to make informed decisions. Access to accurate, reliable news can strengthen democracy and foster a more knowledgeable public.

However, there are challenges with how news is often delivered, including sensationalism, bias, and misinformation. Media outlets may prioritize profit or political agendas over objectivity, leading to polarization and confusion among audiences. The rise of ""fake news"" and the spread of misleading information can undermine trust in journalism as a whole.

For these reasons, my view on news is mixed—it has the potential to do great good, but it also requires careful consumption and critical thinking to separate facts from agendas."

As time has gone on, we have learned so much about how the world works, and, in my opinion, religion has become more obsolete as science can explain away many religious arguments.  The positive of religion is that it can truly help people feel like they have a little more control over things in their life, which can be comforting.",2,"I think that there are some bad police officers that truly do wrong.  This job makes it very easy to become power and control hungry.  However, I believe that most people get into the job to try to do good.

It is really one of the only ways that ordinary citizens can make larger change.",5,"The immigration system that we have in the US needs to change.  The system we have gives immigration a bad name.  I think that if we are able to make this process more efficient, more people would support it and we wouldn't have all of these tragedies occuring at the border.",5,"Science, in my opinion, is everything.  It explains how our bodies and the world work.  It has given us so much - vaccines, astrology, medicine, etc.  It allows us to expand our world beyond the Earth, as well as allowing us to see learn how our bodies work down to the sub-microscopic level.",3,"I think that the news sources that I consume are reliable.

11890194,4,I think that religion as a concept is mostly good because it can provide a good starting point for morals adn values. There is a good sense of community in religions. While they can be hard to get into since some you have to convert or study they do provide people with lots of emotional support. But there are a lot of religions to choose from so it might be hard to find a good fit if looking around to find a new one.,5,I think the police help us a lot. I think they do way more than we know and there is a science to some of it like when it comes to forensics. I think while there are some bad apples there are steps in place to make sure those people are held accountable so in general the police system is still a very good concept. I feel safer when the police are around even though I don't feel unsafe when they aren't there.,5,Firefighters are great people. They don't seem to have the same fears as the rest of us and they are at risk basically every time they go on a call so they are very brave. I don't think they get enough recognition. They should be held in higher esteem and make more money for what they do for society.,4,"I think healthcare is great and we are able to provide a lot of ways for people to stay healthy or get back to good health.

Some things are over priced but it is nice we have access to them.",5,I think voting is a great way to find out what people think. It is a good baseline for political leaders to make decisions given what they might know as secret information and what the people know and would like to see happen. I think voting in our leaders is good and I wish there were more ways to vote in other people like if the people could vote for a vice president or supreme court justice. ,-2,"In terms of legal immigration I think it is fine but mostly I think about illegal immigration and how much of a strain it puts on society. It costs a lot of money to have people come over illegally in terms of having to house them, give them medical attention and there is a huge backlog of trying to get people through the legal system. It's too easy to come over illegally.",5,Science is a great way to learn about new things and test theories. It can help open up the mind of children into what is possible in the world. I think there are a lot of standards in science to help make sure that the information that is being found and reported on is accurate to the best of the scientists and research process' capabilities. ,-2,While I like the access to the news that we have in it's many forms I think it is way too biased. When the same person owns a vast majority of the news channels it is easy for the channels to all put out the same information or ignore the same information to keep it hidden from society. I don't like it when ads are worked into the news like other news stories because people don't have enough media education to understand that some things are placed ads.

11890400,4,"I feel positive about the concept of religion. Religion can provide individuals and communities with a sense of purpose, belonging, and moral guidance. It often fosters a sense of community, bringing people together around shared beliefs and values, which can lead to supportive relationships and a strong sense of identity. Many religions promote compassion, kindness, and social responsibility, encouraging followers to contribute positively to society and help those in need.

Moreover, religion can offer comfort during difficult times, providing a framework for understanding life’s challenges and losses. It can inspire individuals to seek personal growth and make ethical choices. While I recognize that religion can sometimes be a source of conflict or division, I believe its overall potential for promoting peace, understanding, and compassion outweighs the negatives. Ultimately, religion can enrich lives and encourage a deeper connection to others and the world around us.",3,"I feel neutral about the concept of police. On one hand, police play a vital role in maintaining public safety, enforcing laws, and providing a sense of security within communities. They are often the first responders in emergencies and can offer assistance in various situations, from helping lost individuals to responding to crimes. The presence of law enforcement can deter criminal activity and provide reassurance to citizens.

On the other hand, there are significant concerns regarding police practices, accountability, and systemic issues, such as racial profiling and excessive use of force. Instances of police misconduct can erode public trust and lead to feelings of fear or resentment within communities, particularly among marginalized groups. These complexities highlight the need for police reform, training, and community engagement to ensure that law enforcement serves everyone fairly and justly.

My neutral stance reflects an understanding of both the important role police can play in society and the pressing need for reform to address the challenges and inequalities present within many law enforcement systems.",5,"I feel **extremely positive** about the concept of firefighters. They represent courage, selflessness, and dedication to public service, often putting their own lives at risk to protect others. Firefighters are the first responders in emergencies, from house fires to natural disasters, where they act swiftly and with great expertise to save lives and property. Their work requires immense physical and mental strength, and they consistently show resilience in the face of danger. Additionally, firefighters play a crucial role in the community by promoting fire safety, offering educational programs, and providing support during non-emergency situations. For me, they embody the ideal of public service—individuals who dedicate their lives to ensuring the safety and well-being of others without hesitation. Their bravery and commitment inspire deep respect and admiration.",4,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of healthcare. Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right and essential for promoting individual and societal well-being. Quality healthcare ensures that people can live healthier, longer lives, and it plays a critical role in preventing disease, managing chronic conditions, and responding to emergencies. It reflects the values of compassion, equity, and social responsibility, as everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life regardless of their background or financial situation. While there are challenges within many healthcare systems—such as accessibility, affordability, and disparities in care—the overarching concept of healthcare is crucial to a functioning society. Investing in healthcare improves quality of life, strengthens communities, and contributes to the overall progress of a nation. For these reasons, I deeply value the idea of comprehensive, accessible, and fair healthcare for all.",4,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of voting. Voting is one of the most direct and powerful ways individuals can participate in a democracy and have a say in shaping the future of their communities and country. It represents the right to have a voice in government decisions, ensuring that leaders are accountable to the people they serve. I value the ability to influence policies that affect issues like healthcare, education, civil rights, and the economy. Voting also allows for the expression of diverse perspectives, helping to build a more equitable society where everyone's views are considered. Though the process may have imperfections, the principle of voting is crucial for upholding democratic values and empowering citizens. It's not just a right but also a responsibility to engage in the collective decision-making process.",4,"I feel extremely positive about the concept of immigration. Immigration enriches societies by bringing diverse cultures, perspectives, and talents, which contribute to economic growth, innovation, and social vibrancy. Historically, many countries, including the U.S., have been built by immigrants who have worked hard to create better lives for themselves and their families, while also helping to shape the nation's character. I believe that welcoming immigrants aligns with values of compassion, opportunity, and inclusivity, offering people the chance to escape hardship, seek new opportunities, and contribute to their new communities.

While immigration systems need to be well-managed to ensure fairness and security, the overall concept is deeply tied to justice and human dignity. It reflects a global understanding that people should have the freedom to seek a better life and that societies can be stronger when they embrace diversity and work together. For me, supporting immigration is about creating a world where borders don't limit human potential, and where everyone has a fair chance to thrive.",1,"I feel **positive** about the concept of science. Science is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us, driven by curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. It provides a systematic approach to exploring questions about the universe, human health, and the intricacies of life itself. Through scientific inquiry, we have made incredible advancements in medicine, technology, and environmental understanding, improving the quality of life for countless individuals.

Moreover, science encourages critical thinking and skepticism, promoting an evidence-based approach to problem-solving. It fosters innovation and creativity, enabling societies to address complex challenges such as climate change, disease outbreaks, and food security. While science is not without its limitations and ethical considerations, its ability to drive progress and improve our understanding of the world is invaluable. Overall, I believe that science plays a crucial role in shaping a better future and empowering individuals to make informed decisions.",4,"I feel neutral about the concept of news. On one hand, news is vital for keeping people informed about important events, developments, and issues that affect society. It plays a critical role in promoting transparency, holding those in power accountable, and enabling citizens to make informed decisions. Access to accurate, reliable news can strengthen democracy and foster a more knowledgeable public.

However, there are challenges with how news is often delivered, including sensationalism, bias, and misinformation. Media outlets may prioritize profit or political agendas over objectivity, leading to polarization and confusion among audiences. The rise of ""fake news"" and the spread of misleading information can undermine trust in journalism as a whole.
For these reasons, my view on news is mixed it has the potential to do great good, but it also requires careful consumption and critical thinking to separate facts from agendas."

11890430,2,", to be quite frank, I have always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with religion. On the one hand, I understood that faith could and often does help, unite people in difficult moments, and cause miracles. This has moved me to hear stories of preise in their struggles and how faith provided comfort to friends and family. I have also been touched by various acts of giving by religious bodies to the needy.

On the other hand I am concerned with Wars, civil strife and injustices that stem out of religious differences. It is still hard for me to grasp how teachings that focus on love and compassion could be twisted in order to fulfill directions of hate and separation.",2,"In all honesty, I cannot say that I have the most friendly feelings towards the idea of police. On one hand, I understand and appreciate the work which our police officers perform and their responsibility for preserving life and property. Police officers risk their lives each day to protect and contain, and that must be respected.
However, I would like to make it clear that I too understand the criminal conduct of policemen; brutality, racism, and corruption have had it in them in the past and now. They are undermining with the use of excessive force or force at all when dealing with the black people and especially the lack of charges brought against the officers involved in their brutality. These problems bring some level of distrust and weaken the work of police forces.",2," The people in question hold firefighters in very high regard.

I am grateful to all the firefighters out there; you really are extraordinary and we owe you a lot.",5,"I view healthcare extremely positively due to its vital role in preserving human well-being. It provides life-saving interventions, pain alleviation, preventive measures, and emotional support.

When studies are not rigorously peer-reviewed or are based on biased, small sample sizes, it becomes challenging for consumers to distinguish fact from marketing hype. Furthermore, endorsements from dental professionals who fail to disclose their financial ties to the company further erode public trust. As consumers, we have the right to accurate information to make informed health decisions, and when companies prioritize profit over ethical practices, they endanger public health. This situation underscores the need for stricter regulations in advertising and product claims to protect consumers and maintain industry standards, ultimately emphasizing that integrity and transparency are vital for a trustworthy marketplace.",2,"I feel strongly about the need for integrity and transparency in the health and wellness industry because these values are fundamental to consumer trust and safety. When it comes to products like toothpaste, which we use daily, it’s essential that the claims made by companies are backed by reliable, unbiased research. The recent findings about FreshClean Toothpaste reveal serious ethical issues that could mislead consumers. The fact that the National Oral Health Research Institute (NOHRI) is funded by FreshClean’s parent company raises questions about the impartiality of their study. If research is not independently verified or conducted on a diverse and adequately sized sample, it can’t be considered credible.

Moreover, when dental professionals endorse products without disclosing their financial ties to the company, it further diminishes public trust. Consumers should be able to rely on expert opinions without wondering if they are being influenced by money rather than evidence. This situation highlights the broader issue of consumer protection; when companies prioritize profit over ethical practices, it can put public health at risk. Ultimately, I believe that stricter regulations in advertising and product claims are necessary to ensure that consumers have access to accurate information. A marketplace built on integrity and transparency not only protects individual health decisions but also fosters a culture of accountability and trust, which benefits everyone in the long run.",3,"I feel strongly about the importance of integrity and transparency in the health and wellness industry, especially regarding products like toothpaste that affect our daily lives. Consumers have the right to make informed decisions based on reliable information, so claims about health benefits must be backed by credible, independent research. The recent revelations about FreshClean Toothpaste—specifically the biased funding of the National Oral Health Research Institute (NOHRI) and the lack of peer-reviewed studies—undermine the credibility of the product's claims. Additionally, the failure of dental professionals to disclose financial ties to the company erodes public trust. A marketplace built on integrity and transparency is essential for fostering consumer confidence and ensuring public health. Stricter regulations are needed to hold companies accountable and promote ethical practices, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for everyone.",3,"I am deeply concerned about the integrity and transparency of claims in the health and wellness industry, especially regarding products like FreshClean Toothpaste. Recent revelations about the credibility of its claims, including funding from its parent company and a lack of independent research, raise serious ethical questions. The study supporting FreshClean's efficacy was based on a small sample size with many participants linked to the company, undermining its validity. Moreover, financial ties between endorsing dental professionals and the company suggest conflicts of interest, potentially misleading consumers. Ultimately, I believe consumers deserve truthful, evidence-based information to make informed health decisions, highlighting the need for stronger regulations to ensure accountability in health product marketing and foster trust in the marketplace.",3,"I feel strongly about this concept because it highlights the importance of integrity and transparency in the health industry. Misleading claims and biased research, like in the case of FreshClean, not only damage trust but also risk people's well-being. Consumers need accurate information to make informed health decisions, and when companies prioritize sales over ethics, it undermines public confidence and can have harmful consequences.",-1,"I feel strongly about this issue because it highlights the importance of honesty and transparency in health-related products. FreshClean's misrepresentation of research, biased endorsements, and failure to disclose financial ties undermine consumer trust. The use of a small, biased study funded by the company itself raises ethical concerns, while dentists promoting the product without revealing their financial relationships compromises their credibility. Misleading consumers into believing they are using a superior product based on false claims is dishonest and potentially harmful, prioritizing profit over people's well-being.",3,"I feel strongly about the need for integrity and transparency in the health and wellness industry, particularly regarding products like FreshClean Toothpaste, as our oral health is crucial to overall well-being. Concerns have emerged about the credibility of claims made by the company, especially since the research supporting these claims was funded by FreshClean’s parent company and lacked independent verification. The study's small sample size, lack of peer review, and undisclosed financial ties between endorsing dental professionals and the company further undermine its credibility. I believe consumers deserve truthful information to make informed health choices and advocate for stronger regulations to ensure that companies are held accountable for their marketing practices, fostering a marketplace built on trust and transparency.",2,"I feel deeply concerned about misleading marketing practices and the lack of transparency shown by FreshClean Toothpaste. The revelation that the study supporting FreshClean's claims was conducted by a research institute funded by the parent company undermines its credibility, especially since the trial was not peer-reviewed and involved only a small, biased group of participants. Additionally, the endorsements from dentists who had financial ties to the company further erode trust, suggesting that their recommendations were financially motivated rather than based on the product's actual effectiveness. These deceptive tactics exploit consumers' desire for better health and violate the ethical responsibility companies have to provide truthful information, particularly when it concerns products that impact well-being."

Vaccines, antibiotics, and advanced surgical techniques are just a few examples of how science has saved millions of lives and alleviated suffering.",3,"First and foremost, news serves as an essential tool for accessing information about local, national, and global events. A well-informed society is better equipped to make decisions, respond to challenges, and engage in discussions about pressing issues. Newsoutlets provide valuable insights into politics, economics, public health, and social matters, enabling individuals to understand the context of their world and the implications of events that may impact their lives. In a democratic society, the press acts as a watchdog, holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for transparency."

11890706,1,"I'm not sure how to feel about religion.  I believe in God, and religion is clearly intended to be part of the system of the universe, but I think it's odd that most of the religions believe they are going to prosper in the afterlife while people who follow other religions will potentially not have it easy.  ",2,"I think police are necessary.  However, I do think that police often overstep boundaries.  I wish there were a better solution.  Sometimes I wish police officers would be more human, and sometimes I wish they would be more robotic, instead of throwing a punch or chastising a suspect.  ",5,"Firefighters are necessary for fighting fires.  From what I'm told, the culture of firefighting is perhaps not always as focused on safety as it should be, but I am not involved directly.  ",3,"I think it's important to take care of your health, and to have systems that support your health.  However, I don't always agree with a mainstream definition of health.

However, I would prefer if the popular vote determined the president, because it seems more fair to me.  ",4,"I think it would be great if happy, healthy, productive people from other countries could easily immigrate here, as long as they are extremely charitable.

",4,"I think science is necessary and important.  Sometimes I wish scientific research could be vetted more thoroughly, and disseminated in a responsible way by qualified people to a broad audience, more frequently.  ",-1,"The news can often be boring and tedious.  It's a cultural narrative that doesn't exactly fit what is most important, or what is most interesting.  It is curated by certain people.  Otherwise, I like knowing what's going on.  "
11890707,-3,"Conflicts over religion have caused a lot of pain and suffering in the world and continue to do so. I respect the potential role of religion in an individual's life, whether it gives them purpose or a better moral compass, but I don't have respect for organized religion's involvement in politics. I was also raised in a religious household and I know that myself and many others felt being raised in an overly religious environment was traumatizing and can cause a lot of shame. ",-4,"I dislike the historical precedent of the country's police force as a means to oppress racial minorities and their disproportionate violence against Black people in the US. I think they often act out of fear when they should be the ones de-escalating a situation they're responding to. Given how many people are senselessly killed by police officers every year, it's obvious to me that they're poorly trained and over-armed. Local governments also often direct a lot of our tax dollars to local police forces that few of us feel actually exist to protect us and keep us from harm. ",5,"I grew up in a really small community with a volunteer fire department and had many friends and relatives who served. It isn't easy to go into burning buildings and I respect firefighters potentially risking their lives to save others. I think there is a general sense of trust within most communities for firefighters, which I appreciate. ",3,"As a healthcare worker, I feel generally positive about the people within the industry and promoting access to it. I believe access to affordable healthcare should be a right and not a privilege and that there are so many caring and compassionate people in the industry. I feel less positive about the industry itself and its prioritization of profit over holistic patient care. ",5,"Voting is one of the only ways for citizens to create positive change at the local, state, and federal levels. We can make positive changes by our individual work within our communities, but we also need the legislative support to protect our changes and provide support that indivuduals can't. It's a privilege to be able to vote in fair elections.",5,"I think diversity makes our country great and that our country would suffer greatly without it. From the beginning, immigration is what made America America and I don't like the attitude of ""closing the doors"" at some point because some of us have been here longer than others. We have more than enough room and industry to support people who want a better quality of life for themselves and their families. ",5,"I value my education a lot and believe in the scientific process. Science has provided us with so many technologies, medicines, and theories that shape how we live, our quality of life, and how we understand everything happening around us. ",-1,"I don't appreciate that most media sources seem to push notifications and highlight articles that are negative and/or will stir negative emotions within the reader. Sometimes I think we have potentially too much access to news at all times because of our phones and it's overwhelming for most of us. That does more harm than good because we can't take action about any of the negative things in the news if we're constantly moving on to the next horrible thing going on in the world and feeling pressured to be attending to that (and the cycle continues). I feel negatively about the algorithms that recommend our news and the ragebait-y headlines that are pushed to us, but I respect journalists and appreciate having access to factual information."

11890720,-1,I believe there is a higher power but I dislike how people use religion to justify things. People use religion to back up backward beliefs.

I trust in the scientific method. I may not agree with how results are interpreted by people trying to sway opinions but I still recognize the actual results and can see if they are replicable. ,2,There are a lot of ways to get news but one has to be discerning.

11890732,3,"I feel strongly about religion because it plays a profound role in shaping individuals’ values, morals, and sense of purpose. For many people, including myself, religion provides a framework for understanding the world, finding meaning in life’s challenges, and cultivating a connection with something greater than ourselves. It fosters a sense of community and shared beliefs, offering guidance in difficult times and a moral compass to navigate personal and societal issues.

I value religion for the way it nurtures spirituality and encourages reflection on deeper questions about existence, purpose, and the nature of good and evil. It provides comfort, hope, and strength, particularly when life feels uncertain or overwhelming. Personally, my Christian faith has been a source of inspiration, shaping my outlook on kindness, forgiveness, and humility. I believe that religious teachings, at their core, often promote values like compassion, service, and love, which are essential to building stronger, more caring communities.

At the same time, I understand that religion can be a deeply personal and diverse experience. Not everyone follows the same faith or holds the same beliefs, and I respect that religion means different things to different people. What matters to me is how religion can inspire positive actions, moral growth, and a sense of peace and belonging in the lives of those who practice it.",2,"When it comes to police, what matters most to me is the protection of individual freedoms and personal responsibility, which aligns with my conservative values. I prioritize strong economic policies that support growth and fiscal responsibility, as well as national security. Additionally, I'm invested in upholding traditions that support family values and ensuring that government remains limited in its role, giving more power to local communities and individuals.",2,"I feel strongly about firefighters because it’s the foundation of progress and our understanding of the world. Science offers an objective way to explore natural phenomena, solve problems, and push the boundaries of what we know. I appreciate how it provides a methodical approach to discovery, grounded in evidence, experimentation, and logic. This process builds reliable knowledge that helps us improve healthcare, technology, the environment, and countless other areas that impact daily life.

What resonates with me most is that science is always evolving—new discoveries challenge old ideas, and there’s a constant pursuit of truth. It teaches humility by showing us how much we don’t know while giving us the tools to learn more. Science doesn't just provide answers; it raises new questions, fueling curiosity and innovation. I value it because it encourages critical thinking and open-mindedness, pushing society to continually grow and adapt.

In addition, I see science as a universal language that connects people across cultures, ideologies, and backgrounds. Whether it's addressing climate change, curing diseases, or exploring space, science unites humanity in the pursuit of common goals. That's why I believe so deeply in its importance—it shapes our future and helps us make informed decisions to better the world.",3,"When it comes to Healthcare , what matters most to me is the protection of individual freedoms and personal responsibility, which aligns with my conservative values.

Voting gives individuals a voice in shaping policies, leaders, and laws that affect everyday life, from economic policies to healthcare, education, and social justice. For me, it represents a fundamental right and responsibility in a democratic society. Even though a single vote may seem small, collectively, votes can lead to significant change, and choosing not to vote feels like giving up a critical opportunity to impact the future.

Voting also connects me to the larger political process, making me feel engaged and accountable for the decisions being made by those in power. I believe that if you want to see positive change or prevent policies you disagree with, participating in the electoral process is essential. It’s about ensuring that leaders represent your interests and that policies reflect your values. For this reason, I view voting as more than just a civic duty—it’s a means of empowerment and a way to shape the society I want to live in.",2,"When it comes to immigration, what matters most to me is the protection of individual freedoms and personal responsibility, which aligns with my conservative values.

In an ideal world, the purpose of news is to offer accurate, unbiased reporting that helps citizens stay informed and engaged in the issues that matter most, from politics and the economy to healthcare and social justice.

However, I’m also mindful of the challenges in today’s media landscape, where sensationalism, bias, and misinformation can sometimes distort facts or amplify polarization. It's important to critically evaluate the sources of news and ensure that the information consumed is credible and balanced. News should serve the public good by fostering informed debate, holding power accountable, and keeping people connected to the realities of the world, rather than contributing to division or confusion."

11890883,4,"I feel strongly about religion because it plays a profound role in shaping individuals’ values, morals, and sense of purpose. For many people, including myself, religion provides a framework for understanding the world, finding meaning in life’s challenges, and cultivating a connection with something greater than ourselves. It fosters a sense of community and shared beliefs, offering guidance in difficult times and a moral compass to navigate personal and societal issues.

I value religion for the way it nurtures spirituality and encourages reflection on deeper questions about existence, purpose, and the nature of good and evil. It provides comfort, hope, and strength, particularly when life feels uncertain or overwhelming. Personally, my Christian faith has been a source of inspiration, shaping my outlook on kindness, forgiveness, and humility. I believe that religious teachings, at their core, often promote values like compassion, service, and love, which are essential to building stronger, more caring communities.

At the same time, I understand that religion can be a deeply personal and diverse experience. Not everyone follows the same faith or holds the same beliefs, and I respect that religion means different things to different people. What matters to me is how religion can inspire positive actions, moral growth, and a sense of peace and belonging in the lives of those who practice it.",4,"I feel strongly about immigration because it’s a complex issue that touches on economic, cultural, and human dimensions. On one hand, I recognize the importance of secure borders and the need for a country to regulate who enters and stays, ensuring that immigration benefits society as a whole. It’s about maintaining the safety, stability, and rule of law within a nation, which is crucial for any country to function effectively.

At the same time, I understand that immigration can bring significant benefits, such as cultural diversity, innovation, and economic growth. Many immigrants contribute to society by filling essential jobs, starting businesses, and adding new perspectives to our communities. Historically, countries like the U.S. have thrived because of their ability to integrate people from various backgrounds, creating a more dynamic and resilient society.

However, I also acknowledge that immigration policies need to be fair and compassionate, especially toward people fleeing dangerous situations, seeking better lives, or reuniting with family. It’s a balance between protecting national interests and recognizing the humanity of those wanting to make a life in a new country. For me, finding that balance—between security and opportunity, between rule of law and empathy—is key to how I view immigration.

Voting gives individuals a voice in shaping policies, leaders, and laws that affect everyday life, from economic policies to healthcare, education, and social justice. For me, it represents a fundamental right and responsibility in a democratic society. Even though a single vote may seem small, collectively, votes can lead to significant change, and choosing not to vote feels like giving up a critical opportunity to impact the future.

Voting also connects me to the larger political process, making me feel engaged and accountable for the decisions being made by those in power. I believe that if you want to see positive change or prevent policies you disagree with, participating in the electoral process is essential. It’s about ensuring that leaders represent your interests and that policies reflect your values. For this reason, I view voting as more than just a civic duty—it’s a means of empowerment and a way to shape the society I want to live in.",3,"I feel strongly about immigration because it’s a complex issue that touches on economic, cultural, and human dimensions.

I appreciate how it provides a methodical approach to discovery, grounded in evidence, experimentation, and logic. This process builds reliable knowledge that helps us improve healthcare, technology, the environment, and countless other areas that impact daily life.

What resonates with me most is that science is always evolving—new discoveries challenge old ideas, and there’s a constant pursuit of truth. It teaches humility by showing us how much we don’t know while giving us the tools to learn more. Science doesn't just provide answers; it raises new questions, fueling curiosity and innovation. I value it because it encourages critical thinking and open-mindedness, pushing society to continually grow and adapt.

In addition, I see science as a universal language that connects people across cultures, ideologies, and backgrounds. Whether it's addressing climate change, curing diseases, or exploring space, science unites humanity in the pursuit of common goals. That's why I believe so deeply in its importance—it shapes our future and helps us make informed decisions to better the world.",3,"I feel strongly about news because it’s a complex issue that touches on economic, cultural, and human dimensions.

11891267,5,I think religion is something we all have the choice to believe in or not. The best part about religion is there is not just one. There are many religions people can research and decide what one they believe in. I think religion gives people hope and confidence. ,3,Overall I think most police are good. With good there is also bad. Some police are bad but I believe overall most are good. They risk their lives to help protect individuals. Most police have indivduals well-being in mind.,5,I believe firefighters are great people. They risk their lives to help others in need. It take strength and courage to be a firefighter. I admire firefighters. ,0,I stand in the middle when it comes to healthcare. I feel healthcare is necessary for all individuals. I also feel healthcare is too expensive. I would like to see the government take an approach and make healthcare Universal for all Americans. I feel healthcare companies care more about profits than they do patients. ,5,I was taught at an early age to vote. Voting is a right most every American has and should be taken advantage of. Voting helps shape and change the world as we know it today. As Americans we have the ability to put leaders we believe in to places leaders can make change. ,-3,I believe immigration is moving too fast. I don't mind immigrants coming to American but the numbers they are coming is alarming. There are protocols in place to become an American citizen. I understand people are leaving dangerous countries but that doesn't mean we let immigrants pour into American at record numbers. ,4,I think science is necessary to advance. Without science we would be stuck in the same place. Science provides facts that are backed by data. Science provides breakthroughs in modern society we benefit from. ,-2,The problem I have with news is they all report it differently. The same story will be reported differently by different news sources. Also politics comes into decisions on how networks report the news. It's hard to trust the news and sometimes digging deeper is necessary to get the true story.

Other religions can practice their religion without all the pushbacks that Christains get.

It seems you can have relious freedom just as long as you are not Christian.",1,"While I feel that the police are needed, there are a lot of people that have no business being police officers.

We should never cut the pay that firefighters get.,-5,Americans should not have to bear the burden of their tax dolars paying for the healthcare of immigrants either legal or illegal. The prices of medical care should be affordable for the American people. There should be more of a focus on integrating preventative and holistic care with standard medical care. Medical care should be affordable for Americans.,3,I feel that voting is your chance to make your opinion count. I cannot stand people that complain about political candidates but never take the time out to go vote.,-4,The country is full. There needs to be a pause on all immigration at this point. There are too many illegal immigrants sucking up the resources in America and adding to the crime numbers as well.,-1,"While I feel that science can be fascinating as is important for the advancement of healthcare and sociey, I feel that at times it can be compromised. The organizations or universitites that recieve funding from medical research companies or drug manufacturers can influence the outcome of research as many of these companies are not neutral donators.",-2,I feel that so much of the news is being censored for the majority of the American people.

If someone believes in God and it brings them happiness, that is fine. But I don't think there is a force out there that is ruling over the world.

America is the only country I know of that does not have free healthcare for all. I know this country is capable of providing it; we got a taste of it during the pandemic. Obama tried to make it happen, but it failed. Because this country is so greedy and doesn't care about its people, they want to nickel and dime you for your health care but still provide you with the very things (food, products, etc.) that can damage your health or kill you. I can't deny that the healthcare here is top-notch, but it comes at a cost. People like myself hold off on getting proper care or avoid emergency rooms because we're afraid of the expense. It's sad and needs to be stopped!",-4,"Although I do plan to vote in this election, I am still not sure if my vote even matters, especially with the electoral college in place. I remember when Hillary Clinton lost the election years ago due to electoral votes. I feel that our votes won't matter if the Electoral College ultimately decides the winner.

11892163,1,"My feelings about religion are shaped by its potential benefits and the complexities it presents. 

On the positive side, religion often provides individuals with a sense of purpose and community, fostering belonging and support networks. Many religious traditions promote values like compassion and kindness, inspiring charitable work and social justice initiatives that benefit society.

However, my positive view is tempered by the historical and ongoing challenges associated with religion. Conflicts and divisions arising from religious differences can lead to violence and discrimination. Additionally, some religious institutions resist social progress, which can perpetuate harmful attitudes toward marginalized groups and hinder equality.

Ultimately, while I see the positive contributions of religion, I also recognize the need for critical reflection and dialogue to address its challenges. Promoting love and understanding within religious contexts is essential for creating a more inclusive society where diverse beliefs can coexist peacefully.",1,"My feelings about the police are shaped by a combination of their critical role in society and the complexities surrounding their function and conduct. 

On one hand, I recognize that police serve essential purposes. They are tasked with maintaining public order, preventing crime, and responding to emergencies, which can lead to safer communities. Many officers are dedicated individuals who genuinely want to help people and make their communities better. Law enforcement can deter criminal behavior and provide a sense of security for many residents, which is a fundamental aspect of societal structure.

However, there are significant concerns that cannot be overlooked. Reports and studies have highlighted systemic issues within policing, including racial bias, unequal treatment, and instances of excessive force. These issues have led to a loss of trust between police and the communities they serve, particularly among marginalized groups who may feel targeted or discriminated against. Events that have received widespread media attention, such as high-profile cases of police violence, have sparked public outrage and demands for accountability and reform.

Additionally, the way policing is carried out can vary greatly depending on the location and the specific police department, leading to inconsistencies in how laws are enforced and how communities perceive their police forces. This variability can create an environment where some people feel protected by police while others feel threatened or marginalized.

Ultimately, my feelings about the police reflect a desire for a balanced approach: recognizing the importance of law enforcement while advocating for reforms that address systemic issues, promote accountability, and foster positive relationships between police and the communities they serve. It's crucial to find ways to improve policing practices, ensuring that they uphold justice and protect all members of society equally.",4,"My positive feelings about firefighters come from their vital role in protecting lives and property. They are often the first responders in emergencies, displaying bravery and selflessness as they face dangerous situations to help others. Their quick actions can save lives, whether they’re extinguishing fires or providing medical assistance.

Additionally, firefighters contribute to community safety through education and prevention efforts, teaching the public about fire safety and emergency preparedness. 

While I admire their commitment, I also recognize the challenges they face, including mental health issues from the trauma of their work. Overall, I view firefighters as dedicated heroes who deserve respect and support for the essential services they provide to their communities.",4,"My strong positive feelings about healthcare come from its essential role in improving health and quality of life for individuals and communities. Access to quality healthcare allows for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of illnesses, which significantly impacts overall well-being.

Advancements in medical science and technology have transformed healthcare, leading to better treatments and innovative practices that enhance patient outcomes. Public health initiatives further promote healthy behaviors and address disparities, contributing to healthier populations.

However, I acknowledge significant challenges, such as access and affordability issues, which can lead to inequalities in health outcomes. Ongoing efforts to improve healthcare systems and ensure equitable access for all are vital. Overall, I see healthcare as a cornerstone of a thriving society, crucial for fostering well-being and resilience.",4,"My strong positive feelings about voting stem from its essential role in democracy and individual empowerment. Voting allows citizens to express their opinions, influence policies, and hold elected officials accountable, ensuring that government reflects the will of the people. 

It fosters civic engagement, encouraging individuals to educate themselves about political issues and candidates. Historically, voting has been a powerful tool for social change, driving advancements in civil rights and public policy.

However, I recognize challenges like voter suppression, gerrymandering, and misinformation that can undermine the electoral process. Ensuring fair access and maintaining the integrity of elections are vital for a healthy democracy.

Overall, I see voting as a crucial mechanism for empowerment and social change, but I believe ongoing efforts are needed to ensure equitable access for all individuals.",2,"My feelings about immigration reflect a belief in its potential to enhance society while acknowledging the challenges that come with it. I advocate for a balanced approach that prioritizes integration, protects the rights of immigrants, and addresses public concerns in a thoughtful and compassionate manner. Creating an inclusive society where both immigrants and native citizens can thrive is a goal worth striving for, and it requires open dialogue, empathy, and effective policy solutions.",5,"My strong positive feelings about science stem from its significant impact on our understanding of the world and its role in driving progress. Science uses the scientific method, which emphasizes observation and experimentation, allowing us to gather reliable evidence and draw informed conclusions.

One of the most important contributions of science is in medicine, where it has led to life-saving advancements like vaccines and antibiotics. Science also drives technological innovation, improving our daily lives and addressing global challenges like climate change.

Additionally, science fosters curiosity and critical thinking, encouraging a mindset of inquiry that is essential for lifelong learning. While not infallible, science’s self-correcting nature allows for continuous improvement and adaptation.

Overall, I view science as a cornerstone of progress and understanding, vital for informed decision-making and a better future for humanity.",3,"My feelings about news are shaped by its dual role as a vital source of information and the challenges associated with its consumption in the modern landscape.

On one hand, news serves an essential function in society. It keeps people informed about local and global events, from politics and economics to culture and science. This information is crucial for fostering civic engagement, allowing individuals to participate in discussions about issues that affect their communities and the world at large. In a democratic society, access to reliable news is fundamental for holding those in power accountable and promoting transparency. News organizations can amplify marginalized voices and bring attention to critical social issues that might otherwise be overlooked.

Moreover, news can facilitate public discourse and contribute to a shared understanding of complex topics. It helps people develop opinions based on various perspectives, encouraging informed discussions and debates that are necessary for a functioning democracy. When news is reported responsibly, it can educate the public and inspire action, whether through advocacy, community organizing, or simply raising awareness about important issues.

However, my positive view of news is tempered by significant concerns regarding its quality and reliability. The rise of misinformation, especially through social media, has created an environment where it's increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction. Sensationalist reporting can overshadow important stories, leading to a focus on clickbait rather than substantive journalism. This can contribute to public distrust in the media and fuel polarization, as individuals may gravitate toward sources that reinforce their existing beliefs rather than challenge them.

Additionally, the concentration of media ownership can limit the diversity of perspectives presented, leading to biased reporting and a lack of representation for certain communities. The pressure to generate clicks and views can compromise journalistic integrity, resulting in a focus on entertainment over informative content.

These complexities highlight the importance of media literacy in today's world. Being able to critically evaluate news sources and discern credible information is more crucial than ever. Encouraging discussions about media consumption and promoting responsible journalism are essential steps toward addressing these challenges.

Overall, my feelings about news reflect an appreciation for its vital role in society, coupled with a recognition of the pressing issues that need to be addressed to ensure it serves the public good effectively. It’s a concept that requires ongoing reflection, improvement, and engagement from both consumers and producers to fulfill its potential in fostering an informed and active citizenry."

11892183,5,"I am giving the ""extremely positive"" rating to the one true religion, Catholicism. I converted and became a Catholic a little more than five years ago. I had previously been a very disparing and depressed agnostic and so in that sense, I was without religion and in fact, very cynical. But by God's grace I converted.
